This is my first programming project, a discord bot mainly to search anime pictures and websites, play music, and provide some server utilities. Invite the bot [**here**](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=593838271650332672&permissions=2113793271&scope=bot)!

This project is still a wip (beta version) so there might be commands that don't work as intended or which throw an exception.
